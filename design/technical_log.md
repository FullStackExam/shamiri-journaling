## 3. Authentication Strategy

### Problem Statement
We needed to implement a secure, scalable authentication system that balances security, user experience, and development complexity.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Session-based Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler to implement and understand
  - Works well with server-rendered applications
  - Easier to invalidate sessions server-side
- **Cons**:
  - Requires session storage on the server
  - More challenge with scaling across multiple servers
  - CSRF vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented

#### Option 2: JWT-based Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Stateless, no server-side storage required
  - Works well with API-based architectures
  - Easier to scale horizontally
  - Can contain user information and permissions
- **Cons**:
  - Cannot be invalidated before expiration without additional systems
  - Token size can grow large with many claims
  - Security concerns if not implemented correctly

#### Option 3: OAuth/OpenID Connect with Third-party Providers
- **Pros**:
  - Delegates authentication to specialized providers
  - Reduces password management burden
  - Often includes additional security features like MFA
- **Cons**:
  - External dependency on third-party services
  - More complex implementation
  - Less control over the authentication process

### Decision
We chose **JWT-based Authentication with HTTP-only cookies** for refresh tokens and short-lived access tokens.

### Rationale
This approach provides a good balance of security and scalability:

1. **Stateless operations**: JWTs allow stateless authentication which will support our future scaling needs.

2. **Security balance**: Using HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens protects against XSS attacks, while the short-lived access tokens limit the impact of token theft.

3. **User experience**: Users stay logged in securely without frequent re-authentication.

4. **Implementation complexity**: This approach is well-documented and can be implemented within our timeframe.

5. **Scalability**: Works well with both our initial monolith and future microservices architecture.

### Trade-offs and Consequences

- **Positive**: Better security than basic JWT implementations
- **Positive**: Good developer experience with well-understood patterns
- **Positive**: Scales well with distributed systems
- **Negative**: More complex than simple session-based auth
- **Negative**: Requires both token and cookie management
- **Negative**: Need for refresh token rotation adds complexity
